# FORT (フォート)

    **BGG Rating:** 7.4/10 | **Available on BGA:** Yes

## Game Overview

FORT is a charming deck-building game about childhood friendships and fort-building. Players recruit kids from the neighborhood to help build the ultimate fort, but friendships are fickle - unused friends might abandon you for other players!

The game features a unique "follow" mechanic where other players can benefit from your actions, and a friendship system where neglected cards can be stolen by opponents, creating constant tension between card efficiency and relationship maintenance.

## Components

### Friend Cards (120+ cards)
Each representing a neighborhood kid with:
- **Name and artwork**: Unique character design
- **Suit color**: Public (white) or Private (colored) 
- **Pizza/Toy values**: Resources the friend provides
- **Special abilities**: Unique effects when played

### Starting Decks (4 identical sets)
- **5 Maiko cards**: Your best friend (2 Pizza, 1 Toy)
- **2 Interesting Kid cards**: Basic friends
- **3 Shy Kid cards**: Minimal resources but reliable

### Fort Boards (4 player boards)
Track your fort's development and special abilities.

### Resource Tokens
- **Pizza tokens**: Primary currency
- **Toy tokens**: Secondary currency  

### Lookout Tokens
Mark friends that can't be stolen this round.

## How to Play

### Turn Structure

#### 1. **Play a Friend (Mandatory)**
- Choose one friend card from your hand
- Gain Pizza and/or Toys shown on the card
- Activate any special abilities
- Place played card in your discard pile

#### 2. **Follow Opportunities (All Players)**
- Other players may "follow" your action
- To follow: discard a card matching the suit of the played friend
- Following players gain reduced benefits
- Only the active player gets full benefits and abilities

#### 3. **Make Best Friends (Optional)**
- Spend resources to recruit new friends from the Park (market)
- Best Friend cards go directly to your hand
- Regular friends go to your discard pile
- Some friends have recruitment requirements

#### 4. **Fort Building (Optional)**
- Spend resources to advance your Fort track
- Gain permanent abilities and victory points
- Some Fort levels provide end-game scoring bonuses

#### 5. **Clean Up**
- Friends you didn't use can be "stolen"
- Other players can recruit unused friends from your yard
- Draw back up to your hand size
- Refresh the Park if needed

### Friendship Mechanics

#### **Following System**
- When someone plays a friend, you can follow by discarding a matching suit
- Following gives you partial benefits without using your turn
- Creates tough decisions about when to help others

#### **Friend Stealing**
- Unused friends in your hand become vulnerable
- Other players can recruit them during their turns
- Use Lookout tokens to protect specific friends
- Stolen friends go to the recruiting player's discard pile

#### **Suit Colors**
- **Public Friends (white)**: Anyone can follow these
- **Private Friends (colored)**: Only players with matching suits can follow
- **Best Friends**: Always private, powerful abilities

- **Level 1-2**: Basic fort abilities
- **Level 3-4**: Intermediate powers and scoring
- **Level 5**: Major abilities and victory points
