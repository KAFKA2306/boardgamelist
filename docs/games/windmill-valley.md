- **Water:** Essential for windmill operation and production chains

### Engine Building Tips
1. **Start Simple:** Build basic production before complex chains
2. **Plan Connections:** Consider how windmills will work together
3. **Balance Resources:** Don't over-specialize in single resource types
4. **Timing Matters:** Build production early, optimize efficiency later

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- **Windmill Overbuilding:** Too many windmills without production support
- **Tulip Neglect:** Ignoring tulip fields reduces scoring potential
