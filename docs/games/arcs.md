## Game Overview

Arcs is a space empire-building game that combines trick-taking mechanics with asymmetric faction powers and political maneuvering. Designed by Cole Wehrle (Root, Oath), it delivers the depth and drama of a 4X game in a compact, card-driven format that emphasizes strategic decisions and wild swings of fortune.
