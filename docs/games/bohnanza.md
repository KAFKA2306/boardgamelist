# BOHNANZA (ボーナンザ)

    **Players:** 2-7 | **Time:** 45 minutes | **Complexity:** 1.6/5  
    **BGG Rating:** 7.0/10 | **Available on BGA:** Yes

## Game Overview

BOHNANZA is a brilliant card game about bean farming and trading. Players cultivate different types of beans in their fields, harvesting them for coins when they have enough of the same type. The key twist: you must play cards in the order you draw them, making trading essential for success.

The game combines hand management, negotiation, and timing in a unique way that creates constant player interaction and difficult decisions about when to harvest your beans.

## Components

### Bean Cards (154 cards)
- **Coffee Bean (24 cards)**: Most common, lowest value
- **Wax Bean (22 cards)**: Second most common  
- **Blue Bean (20 cards)**: Medium frequency
- **Chili Bean (18 cards)**: Less common, higher value
- **Stink Bean (16 cards)**: Rare, valuable
- **Green Bean (14 cards)**: Very rare
- **Soy Bean (12 cards)**: Extremely rare
- **Black-Eyed Bean (10 cards)**: Ultra rare
- **Red Bean (8 cards)**: Legendary rarity
- **Garden Bean (6 cards)**: Mythical rarity
- **Cocoa Bean (4 cards)**: Ultimate rarity

### Bean-O-Meter Cards (11 cards)
One for each bean type showing harvest values and rarity.

### Coin Tokens
Gold coins earned from harvesting beans.

## Setup

1. **Shuffle** all bean cards into one deck
2. **Deal cards** to each player:
   - 2-3 players: 7 cards each
   - 4-5 players: 6 cards each  
   - 6-7 players: 5 cards each
3. **Place Bean-O-Meter cards** face up where all players can see them
4. **Set aside coin tokens** within reach of all players
5. **Place remaining cards** face down as the draw pile

!!! warning "Hand Order Rule"
    Players must keep their cards in the order received and never rearrange them. This is crucial to the game!

## How to Play

### Game Round Structure

Each player's turn consists of three phases:

#### Phase 1: Must Plant (Mandatory)
1. **Plant the front card** from your hand into one of your bean fields
2. **Optionally plant the second card** if it matches a bean already in one of your fields

#### Phase 2: Draw and Trade (Optional but Recommended)
1. **Draw 2 cards** from the deck and place them face up
2. **Trade Phase**: All players can now trade cards
   - You may trade the 2 face-up cards you just drew
   - You may trade cards from your hand (but must give away cards from the front)
   - Other players may trade cards from their hands
   - All trades must be beneficial to both parties

#### Phase 3: Plant Traded and Drawn Cards (Mandatory)
1. **Plant all face-up cards** (the 2 you drew plus any you received in trades)
2. **Harvest if necessary** when you need space for new beans

#### Phase 4: Draw Cards (Mandatory)
1. **Draw 3 cards** from the deck
2. **Add them to the back** of your hand in the order drawn

### Bean Fields

- **Every player starts with 2 bean fields**
- **Each field can contain only one type of bean**
- **A third field can be purchased** with coins (costs vary by player count)
- **Fields must be harvested entirely** - you cannot remove individual cards

### Harvesting

When you harvest a field:

1. **Count the beans** in that field
2. **Consult the Bean-O-Meter** for that bean type
3. **Take coins equal** to the harvest value shown
4. **Place one harvested bean card face up** in front of you as a coin (= 1 coin)
5. **Return remaining cards** to the discard pile
6. **Field is now empty** and ready for new beans

!!! tip "Harvesting Strategy"
    Rarer beans give more coins for fewer cards, but they're harder to collect. Common beans require more cards but are easier to accumulate.

### Trading Rules

- **Voluntary participation**: Only players who want to trade need to participate
- **Mutual benefit**: All trades must benefit both parties
- **No promises**: Players cannot promise future actions or trades
- **Hand order matters**: If trading from hand, must give cards from the front
- **Active player priority**: The current player decides what happens with their drawn cards

## Winning

The game ends when the deck is exhausted for the third time. Players then:

1. **Harvest all remaining fields**
2. **Count total coins** (both physical coins and face-up bean cards)
3. **Player with the most coins wins**

## Quick Reference Sheet

### Turn Summary
1. **Must Plant**: Front card, optionally second if matching
2. **Draw & Trade**: Draw 2 cards, trade freely with all players
3. **Plant Traded**: Must plant all face-up cards received
