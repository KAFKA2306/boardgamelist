# Sky Team (スカイチーム)

!!! info "Quick Reference"
    **Players:** 2 (cooperative) | **Time:** 20 minutes | **Complexity:** 2.05/5  
    **BGG Rating:** 8.16/10 | **Available on BGA:** Yes | **Spiel des Jahres 2024 Winner**

## Game Overview

Sky Team is a cooperative real-time game where two players work together as pilots landing airplanes safely at airports around the world. One player takes the role of the pilot, the other the co-pilot, and together you must navigate challenging landings with limited communication under time pressure.

**What makes it special:**
- **Real-time cooperative gameplay** with meaningful communication restrictions
- **Asymmetric roles** - pilot and co-pilot have different responsibilities
- **Progressive difficulty** through different airport scenarios
- **High tension** in just 20 minutes of gameplay
- **Spiel des Jahres 2024 winner** - recognized for exceptional accessibility and design

The game creates authentic tension as you manage altitude, speed, engine power, and landing gear while dealing with weather, runway conditions, and air traffic - all while the clock is ticking.

## Setup

### Initial Setup
1. **Choose Airport:** Select one of the airport boards (start with Montreal for first game)
2. **Place Airplane:** Position the airplane token at the starting position
3. **Set Approach Track:** Place airplane at approach altitude and distance
4. **Distribute Role Boards:** Pilot takes pilot board, co-pilot takes co-pilot board
5. **Prepare Dice:** Each player gets 4 dice in their color
6. **Set Scenario Components:** Add any scenario-specific components per airport requirements

### Role Distribution
- **Pilot (Left side):** Controls altitude, axis, radio communication, and landing gear
- **Co-pilot (Right side):** Manages engines, flaps, concentration, and brakes

### Airport Scenarios
Each airport presents unique challenges:
- **Montreal (Beginner):** Basic landing with standard weather
- **Additional airports:** Progressive difficulty with obstacles, weather, and special conditions

## How to Play

### Game Flow
Sky Team plays over exactly **8 rounds**, representing the final approach and landing sequence.

### Round Structure

#### 1. Roll Dice (Simultaneous)
- Both players roll their 4 dice simultaneously
- **Communication Restriction:** No verbal communication allowed during dice placement!
- Players can only communicate through agreed-upon gestures or signals

#### 2. Place Dice (Alternating)
- **Pilot places first**, then players alternate placing one die at a time
- **Strategic placement:** Dice values must match specific requirements for each action
- **Limited slots:** Each action space has limited dice placement spots

#### 3. Resolve Actions (Simultaneous)
Actions resolve based on dice placement:

**Pilot Actions:**
- **Altitude:** Adjust airplane height (critical for approach angle)
- **Axis:** Control airplane direction and approach line
- **Radio:** Communicate with air traffic control
- **Landing Gear:** Deploy gear when approaching runway

**Co-pilot Actions:**
- **Engines:** Manage thrust and speed control
- **Flaps:** Adjust wing configuration for landing
- **Concentration:** Focus to improve precision
- **Brakes:** Control stopping power on runway

#### 4. Check Automatic Events
- **Weather effects** may modify flight conditions
- **Airport-specific events** based on chosen scenario
- **Approach track advancement** brings you closer to landing

### Communication Rules
- **Limited verbal communication** during dice placement phase
- **Pre-game planning** encouraged for signals and strategies
- **Post-placement discussion** allowed for action resolution
- **Emergency communication** permitted for safety checks only

### Landing Conditions
You must successfully manage all critical systems to achieve safe landing:
- **Correct altitude** when reaching runway
- **Proper speed** for touchdown
- **Landing gear deployed** before runway contact
- **Appropriate flap configuration** for approach
- **Successful braking** to stop before runway end

## Components

### Core Components
- **2 Role boards** (Pilot and Co-pilot with distinct action spaces)
- **8 Dice** (4 per player in different colors)
- **1 Airplane token** with approach track
- **Multiple Airport boards** with varying difficulty scenarios
- **Weather tokens** and condition markers
- **Reference cards** for quick rule lookup
- **Sand timer** for real-time pressure (optional advanced rules)

### Airport Scenarios
Multiple airport boards offer progressive challenges:
- **Beginner airports:** Basic landing challenges
- **Intermediate airports:** Weather complications and air traffic
- **Advanced airports:** Multiple obstacles, difficult terrain, night landings

### Quality Components
- **High-quality dice** with clear numbering
- **Intuitive iconography** for quick recognition under pressure
- **Durable boards** designed for repeated play
- **Clear rulebook** with excellent scenario progression

## Winning

### Victory Conditions
**Cooperative Success:** Both players win if the airplane lands safely by meeting all landing requirements:
- Airplane reaches the runway at correct altitude
- All critical systems properly configured
- No catastrophic failures during approach
- Successful runway landing and stop

### Failure Conditions
The team loses if any critical failure occurs:
- **Crash:** Airplane altitude drops to dangerous levels
- **Missed approach:** Failure to configure landing systems properly
- **Runway overrun:** Unable to stop airplane on runway
- **System failure:** Critical aircraft system malfunction

### Difficulty Progression
- **Start with Montreal** for learning basic mechanics
- **Progress through airports** for increasing challenge
- **Master communication** and coordination strategies
- **Attempt expert scenarios** with multiple complications

## Quick Reference Sheet

### Dice Placement Priorities
| System | Pilot Die Values | Co-pilot Die Values |
|--------|------------------|---------------------|
| **Altitude** | High values (4-6) | N/A |
| **Engines** | N/A | Medium values (3-5) |
| **Landing Gear** | Any value | N/A |
| **Brakes** | N/A | Low values (1-3) |

### Critical Timing
- **Round 1-4:** Approach configuration and system checks
- **Round 5-6:** Final approach preparation
- **Round 7-8:** Landing execution and braking

### Emergency Procedures
1. **Communication breakdown:** Use pre-planned signals
2. **Dice shortage:** Prioritize critical systems first
3. **Weather complications:** Adjust strategy per scenario rules
4. **System failures:** Follow airport-specific emergency procedures

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- **Over-communication:** Respect limited communication rules
- **Poor dice management:** Plan placement sequence carefully
- **Ignoring altitude:** Maintain proper approach angle
- **Rushed decisions:** Take time to coordinate effectively

## Strategy Tips

### Communication Strategy
- **Establish signals** before starting for common situations
- **Point to intended spaces** to show placement intentions
- **Use facial expressions** to indicate urgency or problems
- **Practice coordination** to improve timing and efficiency

### Dice Management
- **Plan two moves ahead** when possible
- **Coordinate dice values** between players for optimal placement
- **Prioritize critical systems** during final approach rounds
- **Save specific values** for essential late-game actions

### Role-Specific Tips

**Pilot Focus:**
- **Monitor altitude constantly** - most critical for safe landing
- **Coordinate axis control** with co-pilot's engine management
- **Deploy landing gear** at optimal timing
- **Watch for radio communication requirements**

**Co-pilot Focus:**
- **Manage engine power** to maintain proper approach speed
- **Configure flaps** early for optimal lift characteristics
- **Prepare concentration** for critical moments
- **Ready brakes** for immediate runway touchdown response
