## Agent Task Assignments

### Manager Agent Coordination

When initiating any task, use the following template to call the Manager Agent:

```markdown
@.claude/agents/manager.md

Task Request: [TASK_NAME]
Priority: [HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW]
Context: [CURRENT_PROJECT_STATE]
Requirements: [SPECIFIC_DELIVERABLES]

Manager Agent, please coordinate this task:

Current Situation:
- Project State: Foundation phase with agent system established
- Issue: [SPECIFIC_TASK_DESCRIPTION]
- Constraints: Must maintain beautiful architecture and MkDocs compatibility

Your Task:
[DETAILED_TASK_REQUIREMENTS]

Success Criteria:
- Quality standards met
- No junk files created
- Scalable solution implemented
- Documentation complete

Please determine appropriate agent assignments and coordinate execution.
```

### Specific Agent Call Examples

#### For New Game Documentation
```markdown
@.claude/agents/manager.md

Task Request: Document BOHNANZA board game
Priority: HIGH
Context: Core game requiring complete rulebook documentation

Manager Agent, coordinate new game documentation:

Game Details:
- Name: BOHNANZA („Éú„Éº„Éä„É≥„Ç∂)
- Type: Bean trading card game
- Status: Required core game

Workflow Required:
1. Research phase (Êé¢„Åô‰∫∫ Agent)
2. Content creation (Writer Agent)  
3. Structure integration (Architect Agent)
4. Cleanup and organization (Áâá‰ªò„Åë„Åô„Çã‰∫∫ Agent)

Expected Deliverable:
Complete BOHNANZA documentation following project template standards.
```

#### For Architecture Changes
```markdown
@.claude/agents/manager.md

Task Request: Implement BGG integration system
Priority: HIGH
Context: Need automated BGG data fetching for all games

Manager Agent, coordinate architectural enhancement:

Technical Requirements:
- BGG API integration
- Automated rating updates
- Fallback for API failures
- Performance optimization

Agent Sequence:
1. Architect Agent - Design integration system
2. Êé¢„Åô‰∫∫ Agent - Validate BGG data sources
3. Áâá‰ªò„Åë„Åô„Çã‰∫∫ Agent - Clean up any test files

Success Criteria:
- All games show current BGG ratings
- System handles API rate limits
- No manual data entry required
- Clean implementation without junk files
```

#### For Maintenance Tasks
```markdown
@.claude/agents/manager.md

Task Request: Weekly project maintenance
Priority: MEDIUM
Context: Scheduled cleanup and quality assurance

Manager Agent, coordinate maintenance workflow:

Maintenance Scope:
- File organization audit
- Link validation check
- Performance optimization review
- Documentation currency update

Agent Assignments:
1. Áâá‰ªò„Åë„Åô„Çã‰∫∫ Agent - File cleanup and organization
2. Architect Agent - Performance and structure review
3. Êé¢„Åô‰∫∫ Agent - External link validation

Quality Gates:
- Zero junk files remaining
- All internal/external links functional
- Build performance under 2 seconds
- Naming conventions 100% compliant
```

## Development Workflow Integration

### Task Initiation Protocol
1. **Identify Task**: Determine task type and priority
2. **Call Manager Agent**: Use appropriate template above
3. **Agent Coordination**: Manager determines agent sequence
4. **Execution Monitoring**: Track progress through agent reports
5. **Quality Validation**: Ensure deliverables meet standards
6. **Cleanup Verification**: Confirm no junk files created

### Success Metrics Tracking
- [ ] Games documented: 0/6 core games complete
- [ ] File organization score: Target 95%+ clean
- [ ] Build performance: Target <2 second load times
- [ ] Cross-references: All internal links valid
- [ ] Quality score: Target 90%+ content standards met

## Emergency Task Protocols

### Critical Issue Response
If critical issues arise, use URGENT priority:

```markdown
@.claude/agents/manager.md URGENT

Critical Issue: [ISSUE_DESCRIPTION]
Impact: [PROJECT_BLOCKING|DATA_LOSS|SECURITY]
Context: [IMMEDIATE_SITUATION]

Manager Agent, execute emergency protocol:

Immediate Requirements:
- [SPECIFIC_URGENT_NEEDS]
- [STAKEHOLDER_NOTIFICATION_REQUIRED]
- [RESOLUTION_TIMELINE]

Agent Mobilization:
Priority agents needed: [ARCHITECT|CLEANUP|SEARCH|WRITER]

Expected Resolution:
[CLEAR_SUCCESS_CRITERIA]
```
