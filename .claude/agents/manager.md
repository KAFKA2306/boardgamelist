- Check for latest updates/errata
- Confirm BGG ratings and rankings

Deliverable Format:
```json
{
  "game": "name",
  "bgg_id": 12345,
  "data": { /* structured game data */ },
  "sources": ["url1", "url2"],

If 片付けする人 Agent identifies structural issues, call Architect Agent for solutions.

## Decision Making Framework

### Task Prioritization Matrix
```yaml
High Priority:
  - Core 6 games documentation (BOHNANZA, HackClad, イスタンブール選択と集中, FORT, Fixer, National Economy Mesena)
  - Critical bugs or broken functionality
  - Security or quality issues

Medium Priority:
  - Feature enhancements
  - Performance optimizations
  - Additional game documentation

Low Priority:
  - Nice-to-have features
  - Minor UI improvements
  - Advanced integrations
```

### Agent Selection Logic
```python
def select_agent(task_type, context):
    if task_type == "new_game":
        return ["探す人", "writer", "片付けする人"]
    elif task_type == "structure_change":
        return ["architect", "片付けする人"]
    elif task_type == "content_update":
        return ["writer", "片付けする人"]
    elif task_type == "maintenance":
        return ["片付けする人", "architect"]
    elif task_type == "research":
        return ["探す人"]
    else:
        return ["architect"]  # Default to architecture review
```

## Communication Protocols

### Status Reporting Format
```yaml
agent_status:
  timestamp: "2025-08-14T10:30:00Z"
  project_phase: "foundation|development|optimization|maintenance"
  active_tasks: ["task1", "task2"]
  completed_today: ["completed_task"]
  issues: ["issue_description"]
  next_actions: ["planned_action"]
  resource_needs: ["requirement"]
```

### Inter-Agent Coordination
