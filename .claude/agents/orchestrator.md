# Agent Orchestration System

## Overview
This document defines the orchestration system for the BoardGameList agent network, ensuring smooth coordination, clear communication protocols, and beautiful architecture maintenance across all agents.

## Agent Network Architecture

### Primary Agent Hierarchy
```
Manager Agent (Orchestrator)
├── Architect Agent (System Design)
├── Writer Agent (Content Creation)
├── 片付けする人 Agent (Cleanup & Organization)
└── 探す人 Agent (Research & Discovery)
```

### Communication Flow Patterns
```yaml
centralized_coordination:
  - Manager Agent serves as central orchestrator
  - All major decisions flow through Manager
  - Cross-agent communication logged and tracked

distributed_execution:
  - Agents execute tasks independently within scope
  - Direct agent-to-agent communication for efficiency
  - Automatic escalation to Manager for conflicts

emergency_protocols:
  - Direct communication bypasses normal flow
  - Immediate escalation for critical issues
  - Manager Agent notified of all emergency actions
```

## Inter-Agent Communication Protocols

### Standard Communication Format
```yaml
message_structure:
  timestamp: "ISO 8601 format"
  calling_agent: "agent_name"
  called_agent: "target_agent_name"
  trigger_condition: "specific_trigger_that_initiated_call"
  priority: "high|medium|low"
  context: "current_situation_description"
  task_request: "specific_deliverable_needed"
  timing_requirement: "completion_deadline"
  callback_required: "yes|no"
  success_criteria: "measurable_outcomes"

response_structure:
  timestamp: "ISO 8601 format"
  responding_agent: "agent_name"
  original_request_id: "reference_to_request"
  status: "completed|in_progress|blocked|failed"
  deliverables: "list_of_completed_work"
  issues_encountered: "problems_or_limitations"
  next_recommendations: "suggested_follow_up_actions"
  callback_agent: "next_agent_to_call_if_any"
```

### Timing Enforcement Rules
```yaml
immediate_response: "Within 1 minute for emergency situations"
urgent_response: "Within 15 minutes for high priority"
standard_response: "Within 1 hour for medium priority"
research_response: "Within 4 hours for information gathering"
project_response: "Within 24 hours for project deliverables"

escalation_triggers:
  - response_time_exceeded: "Auto-escalate to Manager"
  - resource_conflicts: "Manager arbitration required"
  - quality_standards_unmet: "Manager intervention needed"
  - scope_creep_detected: "Manager approval required"
```

## Agent Coordination Mechanisms

### Task Synchronization
```yaml
synchronous_handoffs:
  description: "Agent waits for completion before proceeding"
  use_cases:
    - "Writer waits for Search research completion"
    - "Cleanup waits for Architect structure guidance"
  timeout: "Maximum wait time before escalation"

asynchronous_collaboration:
  description: "Agents work in parallel with periodic sync"
  use_cases:
    - "Architect designs while Writer creates content"
    - "Cleanup organizes while Search gathers information"
  sync_points: "Defined checkpoints for coordination"

dependency_management:
  blocking_dependencies: "Tasks that must complete before others start"
  non_blocking_dependencies: "Tasks that can proceed with updates"
  circular_dependency_prevention: "Manager intervention for conflicts"
```

### Conflict Resolution
```yaml
priority_conflicts:
  resolution: "Manager Agent arbitration"
  escalation_time: "Within 30 minutes"
  decision_authority: "Manager has final say"

resource_conflicts:
  resolution: "First-come-first-served with priority override"
  manager_override: "High priority tasks can preempt"
  queue_management: "Manager maintains task queue"

quality_conflicts:
  resolution: "Quality standards take precedence"
  reviewer: "Manager Agent validates quality"
  rework_authority: "Manager can require task redo"
```

## Workflow Orchestration

### Standard Workflow Patterns
```yaml
sequential_workflow:
  pattern: "A → B → C → D"
  example: "Search → Writer → Cleanup → Manager"
  coordination: "Each agent waits for previous completion"
  use_case: "New game documentation creation"

parallel_workflow:
  pattern: "A → (B + C + D) → E"
  example: "Manager → (Search + Architect + Writer) → Integration"
  coordination: "Synchronization points for integration"
  use_case: "Large project initialization"

conditional_workflow:
  pattern: "A → If(condition) then B else C → D"
  example: "Cleanup → If(structure_issue) then Architect else Manager"
  coordination: "Decision points with clear criteria"
  use_case: "Maintenance and error handling"

feedback_workflow:
  pattern: "A → B → A → C (iterative)"
  example: "Writer → Search → Writer → Cleanup"
  coordination: "Iterative refinement cycles"
  use_case: "Content quality improvement"
```

### Workflow State Management
```yaml
workflow_states:
  initiated: "Workflow started by triggering agent"
  in_progress: "One or more agents actively working"
  waiting: "Blocked on dependency or external input"
  review: "Awaiting quality validation"
  completed: "All tasks finished successfully"
  failed: "Workflow terminated due to error"
  cancelled: "Workflow stopped by Manager decision"

state_transitions:
  automatic: "Triggered by task completion"
  manual: "Manager Agent intervention"
  timeout: "Automatic escalation after time limit"
  error: "Exception handling and recovery"
```

## Quality Assurance Integration

### Multi-Agent Quality Gates
```yaml
