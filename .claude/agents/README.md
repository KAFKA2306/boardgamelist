# BoardGameList Claude Agents System

## Overview

The BoardGameList project uses a sophisticated multi-agent system to maintain beautiful, scalable architecture while serving multiple user types (humans, AI, LLM, Serena-MCP, developers, players). Each agent has specific responsibilities and clear timing conditions for calling other agents.

## Agent Architecture

### Core Design Principles
- **Beautiful Architecture**: All agents work together to maintain clean, organized code structure
- **Clear Communication**: Each agent must call other agents at clearly described timing conditions
- **No Junk Files**: Zero tolerance for test files, duplicates, or organizational mess
- **Scalable Design**: Architecture supports growth from 6 games to 100+ games
- **Multi-User Support**: Serves humans, AI, LLM, Serena-MCP, developers, players effectively

## Agent Communication Requirements

### Mandatory Timing Conditions
Each agent MUST call other agents at specific times as defined in their individual documentation:

#### Critical Timing Requirements (MANDATORY)
- **Architect ‚Üí Cleaner**: Within 5 minutes of structure changes
- **Writer ‚Üí Researcher**: Within 10 minutes of new assignment  
- **Researcher ‚Üí Writer**: Within 30 minutes of research completion
- **Cleaner ‚Üí Architect**: IMMEDIATELY when structural issues found

#### Standard Timing Requirements
- **Manager responses**: Within 30 minutes for high priority
- **Cleanup triggers**: Within 15 minutes of accumulation
- **Content completion**: Within 5 minutes of finalization
- **Research requests**: Within 2 hours maximum

### System Prompt Requirements
Every agent call must include:
1. **Clear Context**: Current project state and specific situation
2. **Specific Task**: Exact deliverable or action needed
3. **Success Criteria**: Measurable outcomes for completion
4. **Timeline**: When response/completion is needed
5. **Next Steps**: What should happen after task completion

## Usage Guidelines

### Getting Started
1. **Initialize Manager Agent**: Start with Manager for all project coordination
2. **Follow Timing Requirements**: Each agent must respect mandatory timing conditions
3. **Use Proper System Prompts**: Include all required context and success criteria
4. **Monitor Communication**: Ensure all agent calls receive proper responses

### Best Practices
```yaml
always_do:
  - Start workflows through Manager Agent
  - Follow mandatory timing requirements exactly
  - Include complete system prompts with context
  - Monitor for escalation conditions
  - Document all agent interactions

never_do:
  - Skip mandatory agent calls (especially Architect ‚Üí Cleaner)
  - Create junk files (test_*, *_temp, *_updated, etc.)
  - Break naming conventions or directory structure
  - Bypass Manager for major decisions
  - Ignore timeout and escalation rules
```

### Quality Standards
All agents must maintain:
- **File Organization**: Zero junk files, consistent naming
- **Response Times**: Within defined timing requirements  
- **Communication Quality**: Clear, complete system prompts
- **Architecture Beauty**: Clean, scalable project structure
- **Content Quality**: High standards for all deliverables

## Emergency Protocols

### Critical Situations
```yaml
build_failures:
  first_responder: "architect"
  escalation_time: "15_minutes"
  escalate_to: "manager"

junk_file_explosion:
  first_responder: "cleaner"  
  escalation_time: "5_minutes"
  escalate_to: "manager"

content_corruption:
  first_responder: "writer"
  escalation_time: "10_minutes"
  escalate_to: "manager"

research_unavailable:
  first_responder: "researcher"
  escalation_time: "4_hours"
  escalate_to: "manager"
```

### Emergency Communication
- **Bypass Normal Timing**: Emergency situations override standard timing
- **Immediate Manager Notification**: All emergencies escalate to Manager
- **Broadcast Mode**: Manager can send urgent messages to all agents
- **Status Reporting**: Every 15 minutes until crisis resolved

## Configuration Files

### Core Configuration
- **`agent_config.yaml`**: Complete agent definitions and communication matrix
- **`orchestrator.md`**: Detailed orchestration system documentation
- **Communication protocols defined in each agent's markdown file

### Monitoring and Quality Assurance
- **Response Time Tracking**: Monitor all agent communication timing
- **Quality Gates**: Validate all deliverables meet standards
- **Escalation Monitoring**: Track when Manager intervention needed
- **Success Metrics**: Measure agent coordination effectiveness

## Success Metrics
