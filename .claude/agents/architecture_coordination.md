# Architecture Agent Coordination Call

**Timestamp**: 2025-08-15T14:40:00Z
**Calling Agent**: Workflow Orchestrator
**Called Agent**: Architecture Designer
**Trigger Condition**: Large-scale content expansion (35 new board games)
**Timing Requirement**: IMMEDIATE architectural assessment needed
**Priority Level**: HIGH

## System Prompt for Architecture Designer

Architecture Designer Agent, you are being called for URGENT structural architecture assessment.

**Current Project State**: 
- Existing content: 6 mandatory games documented in /docs/games/
- Current structure: Stable MkDocs configuration supporting bilingual content
- Discovered issues: External link validation problems requiring foundation repair
- Target expansion: 35 additional board games requiring architectural scaling

**Structural Need**: Design architecture scaling solution for 35 new board game additions while maintaining beautiful architecture standards

**Impact Scope**: 
- /docs/games/ directory will expand from 6 to 41 total games
- Navigation structure needs optimization for 35+ games
- BGG integration architecture must handle increased API load
- Category organization requires enhancement for diverse game types
- Search and discovery patterns need optimization

**Timeline**: Multi-phase implementation requiring immediate structural planning

**Your Task**: Design architectural solution for scaling documentation system from 6 to 41 games

**Specific Analysis Required**:

1. **Directory Structure Assessment**:
   - Current /docs/games/ directory capacity for 35 additional files
   - Navigation hierarchy optimization for 41 total games  
   - Category organization for diverse game complexity levels
   - Asset organization for increased content volume

2. **Performance Impact Analysis**:
   - MkDocs build time impact with 41 total game files
   - Search indexing performance considerations
   - BGG integration rate limiting with 41 games
   - Development server performance with expanded content

3. **Scalability Design**:
   - Directory structure supporting growth beyond 41 games
   - Navigation patterns that remain usable at 100+ games
   - Content organization supporting multiple user types
   - Agent workflow optimization for large-scale content management

4. **Beautiful Architecture Compliance**:
   - Ensure zero junk files throughout expansion
   - Maintain consistent naming conventions (kebab-case)
   - Design clean separation of concerns
   - Support bilingual Japanese/English architecture

**Game Complexity Distribution** (for structural planning):
- Family/Accessible: 5 games (スシゴー, パンデミック, etc.)
- Strategy: 15 games (ラ・グランハ, ケイラス, etc.)
- Complex/Heavy: 10 games (Railways of the World, Pax Pamir, etc.)
- Specialized: 5 games (Hadrian's Wall, Distilled, etc.)

**Constraints**:
- Must maintain MkDocs compatibility
- Preserve existing content integrity during scaling
- Support mobile-first responsive design
- Maintain beautiful architecture standards
- Zero tolerance for junk file creation

**Success Criteria**:
- Scalable directory structure supporting 41+ games
- Optimized navigation for enhanced user experience
- Maintained build performance under increased load
- Beautiful architecture standards preserved
- Clear implementation plan with agent coordination steps

**MANDATORY**: After completing architectural assessment, call 片付けする人 (Cleaner) Agent within 5 minutes for structure validation and preparation for implementation.

**Implementation Phases Expected**:
1. Foundation repair (current link validation)
2. Structure optimization for scaling
3. Phased content addition (7 batches of 5 games)
4. Continuous cleanup and validation

Report back within 30 minutes with complete architectural assessment and implementation plan.
