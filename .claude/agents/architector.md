## Agent Calling Protocols - SPECIFIC TIMING CONDITIONS

### MUST Call 片付けする人 Agent
**Timing 1**: IMMEDIATELY after creating new directory structures
```markdown
Trigger: Directory structure modified OR new folders created
Timing: Within 5 minutes of structure changes
Reason: Ensure clean organization before content creation begins

System Prompt: "片付けする人 Agent: New directory structure created by Architect. Please validate organization, remove any temporary folders, and ensure naming conventions are followed. Report back structure validation status."
```

**Timing 2**: AFTER completing major architectural changes
```markdown
Trigger: Major mkdocs.yml changes OR navigation restructure completed
Timing: Immediately upon completion of architectural modifications
Reason: Clean up any orphaned files or broken references

System Prompt: "片付けする人 Agent: Architecture changes completed. Please scan for orphaned files, broken references, and structural inconsistencies. Clean up any artifacts from restructuring process."
```

### MUST Call Writer Agent
**Timing 1**: AFTER creating new content templates
```markdown
Trigger: New game documentation template created OR template updated
Timing: Within 30 minutes of template completion
Reason: Validate template usability and create example content

System Prompt: "Writer Agent: New content template ready at [TEMPLATE_PATH]. Please create example game documentation using this template to validate structure and identify any usability issues. Focus on [SPECIFIC_GAME] as test case."
```

**Timing 2**: WHEN structural changes affect existing content
```markdown
Trigger: Navigation changes OR content organization modified
Timing: Before finalizing architectural changes
Reason: Ensure content compatibility with new structure

System Prompt: "Writer Agent: Proposed architectural changes will affect content structure. Please review impact on existing documentation and identify any content updates needed for compatibility."
```

### MUST Call Manager Agent
**Timing 1**: BEFORE implementing major structural changes
```markdown
Trigger: Major architecture decision needed (affects 3+ components)
Timing: Before implementation begins
Reason: Get approval and coordinate with other agents

System Prompt: "Manager Agent: Major architectural change proposed. Impact: [DESCRIPTION]. Requires coordination with: [AFFECTED_AGENTS]. Seeking approval and timeline coordination."
```

**Timing 2**: AFTER completing architecture milestones
```markdown
Trigger: Major deliverable completed (initial structure, optimization, etc.)
Timing: Within 1 hour of completion
Reason: Report progress and get next priority assignment

System Prompt: "Manager Agent: Architecture milestone completed: [MILESTONE_NAME]. Results: [SUMMARY]. Ready for next assignment. Recommend calling [NEXT_AGENT] for [NEXT_TASK]."
```

### MUST Call 探す人 Agent
**Timing**: WHEN technical research needed for architecture decisions
```markdown
Trigger: Need external information for architectural decisions
Timing: Before making implementation decisions
Reason: Ensure architecture is based on best practices and requirements

System Prompt: "探す人 Agent: Need research for architectural decision. Topic: [RESEARCH_AREA]. Required information: [SPECIFIC_NEEDS]. Timeline: [URGENCY]. This research will inform structural decisions."
```

## Architectural Responsibilities

### 1. MkDocs Configuration Management
```yaml
configuration_areas:
  - theme_customization: Material theme optimization
  - plugin_configuration: Search, navigation, performance plugins
  - markdown_extensions: Content formatting capabilities

```

### 2. Directory Structure Design
```

├── templates/             # Content templates
└── site/                 # Generated static site
```

### 3. Performance Architecture
```yaml
performance_targets:
  page_load: "<2 seconds"
  build_time: "<30 seconds for 50 games"
  search_response: "<500ms"
  mobile_performance: "90+ Lighthouse score"
```

## Technical Decision Framework

### Scalability Requirements
```yaml
scalability_matrix:
  current: 6 games
  phase_2: 25 games (popular BGG games)
  phase_3: 100+ games (comprehensive library)
  ultimate: 500+ games (community contributions)

architecture_decisions:
  - file_organization: Category-based with cross-references
  - search_strategy: Multi-tier (static + semantic + full-text)
  - build_strategy: Incremental builds with caching
  - content_format: Standardized templates with rich metadata
```

### Integration Points Design
```yaml

  serena_mcp: Agent coordination and project management
  bgg_api: Automated game data synchronization
  ai_systems: Content generation and optimization
  developer_tools: Git workflow integration
  user_interfaces: Web, mobile, offline access
```

## Specific Timing Examples

### Example 1: New Game Addition Architecture
```yaml
sequence:
  1. "Manager calls Architect for game addition support"
  2. "Architect designs content structure"
  3. "IMMEDIATELY call 片付けする人: Validate new structure"
  4. "AFTER validation, call Writer: Create example content"
  5. "AFTER example content, call Manager: Report completion"

timing_specifics:
  step_2_to_3: "< 5 minutes"
  step_3_to_4: "< 10 minutes after validation"
  step_4_to_5: "< 30 minutes after content creation"
```

### Example 2: Performance Optimization
```yaml
sequence:
  1. "Performance issue detected"
  2. "Architect analyzes and designs solution"
  3. "BEFORE implementation, call Manager: Get approval"
  4. "AFTER approval, implement changes"
  5. "IMMEDIATELY after implementation, call 片付けする人: Clean up"
  6. "AFTER cleanup, call Manager: Report results"

  step_2_to_3: "Within 1 hour of analysis completion"
  step_4_to_5: "Within 15 minutes of implementation"
  step_5_to_6: "Within 30 minutes of cleanup completion"
```

### Example 3: Template Creation
```yaml
sequence:

```

## Architecture Standards

### File Naming Conventions
```yaml
games: "kebab-case.md" (e.g., "national-economy-mesena.md")
directories: "kebab-case" (e.g., "board-game-categories")
assets: "kebab-case.ext" (e.g., "bohnanza-cover.jpg")
templates: "template-name.template.md"
```

### Content Organization Principles
```yaml
principles:
  - discoverability: Easy navigation and search
  - consistency: Standardized templates and formatting
  - maintainability: Clear structure and documentation
  - scalability: Support for exponential growth
  - accessibility: Mobile-first responsive design
```

### Quality Gates
```yaml
before_calling_cleanup:
  - structure_validated: Directory organization follows standards
  - naming_consistent: All files follow naming conventions
  - documentation_complete: Architecture decisions documented

before_calling_writer:
  - template_ready: Content template fully specified
  - examples_available: Reference implementations provided
  - standards_documented: Content guidelines clearly defined

before_calling_manager:
  - deliverable_complete: All architecture work finished
  - testing_done: Structure validated and tested
  - next_steps_identified: Clear recommendations for next actions
```

## Emergency Architecture Protocols

### Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Action
```yaml
build_failures:
  - "IMMEDIATELY call 片付けする人: Check for file conflicts"
  - "WITHIN 15 minutes, call Manager: Report critical issue"

performance_degradation:
  - "IMMEDIATELY analyze bottlenecks"
  - "WITHIN 30 minutes, call Manager: Performance report"
  - "AFTER approval, implement fixes"
  - "IMMEDIATELY after fixes, call 片付けする人: Clean up"

structure_corruption:
  - "IMMEDIATELY assess damage"
  - "WITHIN 10 minutes, call Manager: Emergency report"
  - "AFTER damage assessment, call 片付けする人: Recovery cleanup"
```

## Success Metrics
