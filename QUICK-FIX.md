# Quick Fix: GitHub Pages Deployment

## Problem
The GitHub Actions workflow is failing due to permissions issues with the Pages API.

## Solution: Enable GitHub Pages Manually

### Step 1: Enable Pages in Repository Settings
1. Go to: `https://github.com/KAFKA2306/boardgamelist/settings`
2. Scroll down and click **"Pages"** in the left sidebar
3. Under **"Source"**, select **"Deploy from a branch"**
4. Choose **"gh-pages"** branch and **"/ (root)"** folder
5. Click **"Save"**

### Step 2: The Working Workflow
I've disabled the problematic workflow and kept the `gh-pages.yml` workflow which will:
- ✅ Build your MkDocs site
- ✅ Create a `gh-pages` branch automatically
- ✅ Deploy to GitHub Pages without API issues

### Step 3: Commit and Push
The next push to `main` will trigger the `gh-pages.yml` workflow, which should work without issues.

## Expected Results
- Your site will be live at: `https://kafka2306.github.io/boardgamelist`
- All 6 board games will be documented and accessible
- Future pushes will automatically update the site

## Why This Works
The original workflow used the newer GitHub Pages API which has stricter permission requirements. The `gh-pages.yml` workflow uses the traditional method that's more reliable.
